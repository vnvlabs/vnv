    A linear function was created at this point. The linear 
    function class provides a mechanism for evaluating a linear 
    function. The two **key** parameters here are:

    * slope - The slope of the linear function
    * intersection - The y intersection

  title: "Linear Function Plotter"
  content: |
    This test plots a linear function given the slope and the intersection point. The values
    for DATA::slope and DATA::intersection are automatically populated using values passed 
    to the test.
