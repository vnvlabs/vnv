    An h1 header
    ============
    Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

    2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
    look like:

    * this one
    * that one
    * the other one

    Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
    content starts at 4-columns in.

    > Block quotes are
    > written like so.
    >
    > They can span multiple paragraphs,
    > if you like.

    Unicodese 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
    in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
    Unicode is supported. â˜º
