\usepackage{vmargin}
% All proposals MUST use/include these margin and header settings.

% All proposals MUST use pdflatex and NOT latex/dvips/ps2pdf. Any
% changes to this must have approval from the RNET president and your
% manager. This is to ensure proper margins in all settings.

% ALWAYS use these margins unless the changes are discussed with RNET
% personnel.

%NOTE: When printing, you MUST ensure that ALL scaling is turned OFF
%for both the printer AND the Adobe settings. If Adobe scales the
%document, the printed margins will be WRONG (even if the PDF is
%correct).

% Please, always double check the margins by measuring the margins on the screen, either using a tool that gives a pixel offset of a pointer in a PDF or a ``screen tapemeasure''.

\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} % Used to ensure that PDF latex handles the
