###Injection point specifications

LF_Constructor:
  title: Linear function Constructor
  content: |
    A linear function was created at this point. The linear 
    function class provides a mechanism for evaluating a linear 
    function. The two key parameters here are 
      - slope : The slope of the linear function
      - intersection : The intersection point of the linear function
    
  sections:
     title: First Derivitive
     content: |
       The first derivitive of a linear function is equal to the slope

LF_Eval:
	tilte: Linear Function Evaluation
    content: |
    	Evaluating the linear function. Four parameters are available for 
        inspection. The slope, the intersection, the x value and the result.
        The expected result for this function is 
        $$ result = slope*x + intersection $$.
