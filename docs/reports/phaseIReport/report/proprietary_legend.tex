%% VIII.D. Proprietary Application Information Patentable ideas, trade
%% secrets, proprietary or confidential commercial or financial
%% information, disclosure of which may harm the applicant, should be
%% included in an application only when such information is necessary to
%% convey an understanding of the proposed project.  The use and
%% disclosure of such data may be restricted, provided the applicant
%% includes the following legend on the first page of the project
%% narrative and specifies the pages of the application which are to be
%% restricted: ``The data contained in pages \_\_\_ of this application
%% have been submitted in confidence and contain trade secrets or
%% proprietary information, and such data shall be used or disclosed only
%% for evaluation purposes, provided that if this applicant receives an
%% award as a result of or in connection with the submission of this
%% application, DOE shall have the right to use or disclose the data
%% herein to the extent provided in the award.  This restriction does not
%% limit the government's right to use or disclose data obtained without
%% restriction from any source, including the applicant.''

%% To protect such data, each line or paragraph on the pages containing
%% such data must be specifically identified and marked with a legend
%% similar to the following:

%% ``The following contains proprietary information that (name of
%% applicant) requests not be released to persons outside the Government,
%% except for purposes of review and evaluation.''}

Government purposes, but is relieved of all disclosure prohibitions
and assumes no liability for unauthorized use of these data by third
parties.  This Notice shall be affixed to any reproductions of these
