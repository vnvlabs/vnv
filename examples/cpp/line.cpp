/**
 * @title Line Plot Example. (as a third party test)
 *
 * In this example we plot a simple line plot using the Plotly interface. A number of different
 * line chart options are presented.
 *
 * The vnv plotly interface is a thin RST wrapper around the plotly javascript/json api. We support
 * a large majority of the options available within that api. Function type parameters are not supported
 * at this time.
 *
 * The Plotly Javascript API uses **traces** to allow users to define multiple series within a single chart. Each
 * **trace** is a json object containing the data and configuration parameters that should be applied to that
 * particular data series.
 *
 *  In the VnV API you define **traces** using the *:trace.<name>: <chart-type>* option. For example,
 * in the following plot, the user has defined a trace called main that will be rendered as a scatter chart. You can
 *then set options within that trace using options of the form *:<name>.<option>: <value>*. In second and third options
 *of the chart below, we use the *main.x* and *main.y* options to set the **x** and **y** data for the scatter plot.
 *Layout options are set using the layout.* set of options. Layout options represent global options applied to the chart
 *as a whole, independent of the options set for each individual trace.
 *
 *
 * Users can use the VnV specific <vnv-jmes-path> command to inject into the traces and layout configuration. The VnV
 *report generation software uses regular expressions to replace all commands matching this pattern prior to rendering
 *the chart. JMES Path is feature rich JSON query language designed to allow users to quickly and efficiently query json
 *objects. VnV uses a (very slightly) modified implementation of the python jmespath reference implementation to enable
 *jmespath queries to be used to query the VnV simulation data object.
 *
 * In a VnV test (such as this one), all jmes path queries are applied against a json-object-like object containing all
 *data exported using the engine->Put() calls during test execution. For instance, lets say a test makes the following
 *set of calls within a VnV test.
 *
 * .. code:: cpp
 *
 *    engine->Put("x", 100)
 *    engine->Put("y", 200)
 *    engine->Put("y", 300)
 *    engine->Put_Vector("z", {1,2,3,4})
 *    engine->Put("title", "This is the title")
 *
 * Then, the VnV map-like object looks something like this:
 *
 * .. code:: json
 *
 *    {
 *        "x" : [100],
 *        "y" : [200,300],
 *        "z" : [[1,2,3,4]],
 *        "title" : ["This is the title"]
 *    }
 *
 * The most important thing to notice here is that the map-like object maps parameter names to arrays. For example, if
 *this were a python dict, a command like object["x"[0] would be required to fetch the value written for the variable
 ***x**. This may seem a little counterintuitive, however, we chose to do this because it allows for better data
 *collection across tests. For example, in the example above, the user has made to calls to
 * **engine->Put("y",...). In the map like object, this is represented as a vector of length=2. That is to say, within
 *the context of the test, VnV collects values with the same name into a vector. This makes it infinetly easier to
 *collect and plot data within injection point loops. (recall from the injection point example -- tests can be called
 *any number of times. )
 *
 * For a full  tutorial on JMES Path and VnV please see the VnV JMES Path tutorial `todo <#>`_. VnV supports the entire
 *JMESPath query language, including features like vector slicing.
 *
 *
 * Most of the examples below come from the Plotly javascript `simple line chart tutorial
 *<https://plotly.com/javascript/line-charts/>`_
 *
 * .. vnv-plotly::
 *    :trace.main: scatter
 *    :main.x: {{as_json(x)}}
 *    :main.y: {{as_json(y)}}
 *    :layout.title.text: The Time Was {{time}}
 *
 * You can add two data series to the same chart by adding another trace
 *
 * .. vnv-plotly::
 *    :trace.main: scatter
 *    :trace.second: scatter
 *    :main.x: {{as_json(x)}}
 *    :main.y: {{as_json(y)}}
 *    :second.x: {{as_json(x)}}
 *    :second.y: {{as_json(z)}}
 *    :layout.title.text: The time was {{time}}
 *
 * You can also remove the lines on a series and/or add a custom name to the series. Nested parameters
 * can also be set. Basically, you can add as much or as little information to the plots as you like.
 *
 *
 * .. vnv-plotly::
 *    :trace.main: scatter
 *    :trace.second: scatter
 *    :main.x: {{as_json(x)}}
 *    :main.y: {{as_json(y)}}
 *    :second.x: {{as_json(x)}}
 *    :second.y: {{as_json(z)}}
 *    :second.mode: markers
 *    :second.name: second series
 *    :second.marker.size: 10
 *    :layout.title.text: The time was {{time}}

  // Tests have direct access to the variables passed by the injection point. The fastest way to access variables
  // in to use the GetRef_NoCheck macro. This macro takes two parameters, the variable name, and the class of the
  // variable. VnV passes injection point parameters around using void* pointers. Thus, to access the injection point
  // parameters, the user must know the type of the parameter.

  // GetRef_NoCheck casts from void* through to <type>* before returning a <type>& reference. The NoCheck option turns
  // off implicit VnV type checking (which is still a little buggy, exspecially when templates are involved.) Once the
  // bugs are ironed out, we will depreciate the GetRef_NoCheck macro.

  auto z = GetRef_NoCheck("z", std::vector<double>);

  // The engine object is used to store data. In this case, the user has stored the value "t" with the name "time".
  // Statements of the type engine->Put() are considered to be global varaibles. Thus, engine->Put statements only have
  // an effect on the root processor of the communicator defined by the injection point.
  engine->Put("time", t);

  // To put a vector, users can use the Put_Vector function. Put_Vector assumes a global vector indexed by the rank of
  // the processor within the injection points communicator. For instance, engine->Put_Vector("r",{rank}) would create a
  // single vector {0,1,2...,n} where **n** is the number of processors in the vector. Put_Vector requires all vectors
  // have the same size across processors.
  engine->Put_Vector("x", x);
  engine->Put_Vector("y", y);
  engine->Put_Vector("z", z);
