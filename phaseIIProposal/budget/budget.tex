%% {\em Complete the Research and Related Budget form in accordance with
%%   the instructions on the form (Activate Help Mode to see
%%   instructions) and the following instructions.  You must complete a

%%   work, meet all the criteria for allowability under the applicable

%\section{Budget Justification} %(Field K on the form). 

%% {\em Provide the required supporting information for all proposed
%%   costs (See R\&R Budget instructions.  Attach a single budget
%%   justification file (will not count in page limit) for the entire
%%   project period in Field K.  The file automatically carries over to
%%   each budget year.  Please note, if you are selected for an award,
%%   additional budget information will most likely be required.

%%   Notes regarding Budget:
  
%%   \begin{itemize}
%%     \item Although there is no absolute cap on indirect costs, grant
%%       applications will be evaluated for overall economy and value to
%%       DOE.

%%     \item Tuition expenses are only allowable if requested from a
%%       subcontractor that is a University and if the amount requested
%%       for tuition is reasonable and comparable to the amount a student
%%       would be paid for performing research during the grant period.

%%     \item Travel funds must be justified and directly related to the
%%       needs of the project.  Travel expenses for technical conferences
%%       are not permitted unless the purpose of attending the conference
%%       directly relates to the project (e.g., to present research
%%       results of the project).  Funds to cover travel expenses outside
%%       of the U.S. is considered an unallowable cost unless written
%%       approval has been obtained from the SBIR/STTR Program Manager.

%%      \item Grants may include a profit or fee for the small business.

%%      \item Any commercial and/or in-kind contribution to the project
%%        should be reflected in the project narrative and not included
%%        on the budget pages.

\section{Section A -- Senior/Key Personnel}
Dr. Sabin will manage the entire project and conduct the majority of
the work for this project. Mr. Narayanan and an additional research
scientists (currently being hired, to start in May of 2017) will
assist him in the design and implementation efforts during the Phase
II.

\section{Section B -- Other Personnel}
No other personnel.

\section{Section C -- Equipment Description (Items Exceeding \$5,000)}
No major equipment.

\section{Section D -- Travel}
There will be three meetings with the DOE Program Manager and interested
DOE scientists. The first will be a kick-off meeting to start the
contract and ensure that the DOE needs are met. The second is a review
meeting toward the end of the project to discuss the project status.
RNET is budgeting a minimal amount for travel. Any additional RNET
travel expenses (e.g., if both meetings are in person) will be paid
from internal RNET funding.

\section{Section E -- Participant/Trainee Support Costs}
None
  
\section{Section F -- Other Direct Costs}
\subsection{Subcontract}

Oakridge National Laboratory is subcontractor on this project. The ORNL budget
and a letter of commitment are attached to this proposal submission.

\section{Section H -- Indirect Costs}
RNET uses a labor overhead of 56\%. This overhead includes, fringe
benefits (holidays, sick leave, vacation, health-care benefits and
retirement contributions), payroll taxes, and other indirect charges.

RNET charges 7\% for ``General and Administrative'' tasks (G\&A),
including accounting, payroll services, office rent, office supplies,
telephone, Internet connection, etc.

\section{Section J -- Fee}
