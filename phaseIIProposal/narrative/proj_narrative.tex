%% \textbf{Project Narrative} %(Field 7 on the form)
%% {\em The project narrative must be no longer than 20 pages of text.
%%   It must be typed in 12-point, with 1 inch margins.  All grant
%%   applications must be submitted in response to a specific technical
%%   topic and subtopic announced in this notice.  This information
%%   should be identified in a header on each page of the project
%%   narrative as well as on the SF 424 R\&R in the title field (number
%%   11).

%%   Grant applications, submitted to DOE under SBIR/STTR programs, must
%%   provide sufficient information to convince DOE, and members of the
%%   research community who review the grant application, that the
%%   application is responsive to the topic and subtopic under which it
%%   is submitted, that the proposed work represents a sound approach to
%%   the investigation of an important scientific or engineering
%%   question, and that it is worthy of support under the stated
%%   criteria.  The Phase I grant application should describe
%%   self-contained research that will contribute to proving scientific
%%   or technical feasibility of the approach or concept.  It should be
%%   written with the care and thoroughness accorded papers for
%%   publication--direct, concise, informative, and free from grammar,
%%   typographical, and spelling errors.  Illustrations and charts should
%%   be clearly labeled and correctly referenced in the text. Promotional
%%   and non-project-related discussion detracts from the professional
%%   quality of the proposal.  The work proposed for Phase I, assuming
%%   that it proceeds successfully, should be suitable in nature for
%%   subsequent progression to Phases II and III.

%%   Technical reviewers will base their conclusions only on information
%%   contained in the grant application.  Do not assume that reviewers
%%   are acquainted with the small business, key individuals, or any
%%   theory or experiments referred to, but not described.  (This
%%   includes material in refereed professional journals--those in which
%%   the articles have been subjected to peer review, and material
%%   referenced on Internet Web pages).  Relevant journal articles should
%%   be summarized in the grant application.  Information provided via
%%   Web links will not be reviewed.

%%   Specifically excluded from this funding notice are grant
%%   applications principally for literature surveys, for compilations of
%%   the work of others, for technical assessments, or for technical
%%   status surveys.  If any of these types of tasks are included in the
%%   work plan, the grant (if awarded) may be reduced in proportion to
%%   that effort.  In addition, grant applications primarily for the
%%   development of already proven concepts will be declined, because
%%   such efforts are considered the responsibility of the private
%%   sector.

%%   Narrative descriptions of the technical topics are provided.  Each
%%   technical topic is subdivided into a maximum of 4 subtopics,
%%   designated by the letters a, b, c, or d.  A grant application must
%%   respond to a specific technical topic and, within it, to only one
%%   subtopic.  NOTE: The topic numbers change each year.  Be sure to
%%   identify the correct topic number on the SF 424 R\&R in the title
%%   field (number 11).  The application will be evaluated under the
%%   topic number identified.  The DOE will not be responsible for
%%   reassigning applications to the correct topic number if identified
%%   incorrectly.
