The webpack folder is used to store webpack configurations required to build
js files used in the VnV report generation directives.

For instance 

VolumeViewer uses javascript es6 to generate the js file used in the vti-viewer 
directive. 

These could probably go somewhere else, but I don't want to loose them incase I 
need to modify those js files in some way (i.e. add options, etc)
