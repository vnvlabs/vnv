Source code used to generate the volume viewer js code used in the python
directive. 

This directory sets up a webpack project for generating js files using ES6

Additional paraview components developed for use in the directives will be 
added here. 

Build Instructions:

npm install vtk.js --save
npm install kw-web-suite --save-dev

Had to go into node_modules/vtk.js/Utilities/config/dependency.js and move "localIDentName"
inside the modules key ( ie modules: true --> modules { "localIDentName" ... } ) 


Had to create a file called DropBG in the source folder

npm run build
